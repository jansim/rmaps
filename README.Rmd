# üó∫Ô∏è rmaps: Minimal maps generated with R and ggplot

[![Mockup of rendered map on the wall.](./example.jpg)](./README_files/example.pdf)

Collection of R functions to render minimal maps using `ggplot`.

# Getting Started

This project is not a R package and thus cannot be installed. To use this project, clone the repository and run `renv::install()` to install necessary packages / dependencies (if you do not have `rev`  installed yet, you might have to run `install.packages("renv")` first and restart your R session). 
To quickly render a map, simply run the following snippet of code with the working directory set to this repository.

```{r fig.height=7, fig.width=5, dpi=300, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# This will load all included functions & packages
source("load.R")

# Download mapdata
if (!file.exists(get_cache_path("amsterdam_example", type = "boundingbox"))) {
  # Example bounding box of central Amsterdam
  boundingbox <- st_bbox(c(xmin = 4.861836, ymin = 52.340088, xmax = 4.934535, ymax = 52.401469))
  
  # This will download the data and automatically write it into a cache file
  # so as to not overload the free OpenStreetMaps API. All the cached files
  # can be found in data/cache in the directory of this repository.
  download_mapdata(data_id = "amsterdam_example", boundingbox = boundingbox)
}

# Load the data from cache
mapdata <- load_mapdata("amsterdam_example")

# Render the final map (this function has options for recoloring etc.)
render_map(mapdata)
```

## üñ®Ô∏è Print-ready PDFs

There is also a convenience function to render a full pdf ready for printing in DIN A1 size. If you want to create your own poster it might be a good start to just copy and adjust this function to your liking (or just use it as is!).

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Generate pdf for printing
full_render_to_pdf(
  mapdata,
  name = "Amsterdam, Noord-Holland, Netherlands",
  filename = "example.pdf",
  dir = "README_files"
)
```

The resulting PDF can be found [here](./README_files/example.pdf).
