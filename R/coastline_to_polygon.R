#' Only option I can come up with is to perform an intersection, then check. Heuristics would probably
#' make things faster, like starting with bigger polygons. May happen by default. Could also optimise
#' a bit by performing graph-clustering first, then doing this within each cluster, but I suspect that
#' multiple clusters are rare, due to the way the bounding box is usually selected.
